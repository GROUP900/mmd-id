In 2019, we began developing a new game series set in a distant future where humans have left Earth. The planet is now inhabited by furry anthropomorphic animals.

Later, as more people joined our creative endeavor, GROUP900 began projecting our impressions of the participants onto these anthropomorphic animal characters.

This has become our proudest design legacy. Today, we use MeowMeowLand and these characters as our signature.

The tools in this repository help you build, generate, and display anthropomorphic animal avatars. We developed these tools primarily because we often want to avoid having users upload picture avatars while still allowing user identification through avatars. With these tools, you can easily integrate MeowMeowLand avatars as your software's avatar solution.

While these tools are primarily designed to work with other GROUP900 software, you can absolutely use our avatar solution in your own software.(But we may not be able to provide support)

For developers who just want to use avatars in their projects, you only need to use the [UI package](packages/ui/README.md)
